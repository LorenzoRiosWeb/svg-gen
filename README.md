# SVG Logo Generator
     My project is a SVG Logo Generator, that generates the user a logo using the following shapes, Circle, Triangle, and a Square. You can choose what kind of text color you want and shape color, you can only use 3 characters for the logo as well, in order for it to fit inside of the shape, and part of the criteria as well.
